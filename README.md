# Hotel_Booking_Analysis_EDA_Project
Exploratory Data Analysis on City hotel and Resort Hotel
This EDA project on Hotel Booking Analysis investigates cancellations, and their underlying patterns; and suggests measures that can be implemented to reduce cancellations and secure revenue1:

The project covers booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel including information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children. The project went through the basic idea of the EDA and visualization process.

In this project I will do Exploratory Data Analysis on the given dataset. The project suggests measures that can be implemented to reduce cancellations and secure revenue. For example, hotels can offer discounts or promotions to customers who book early or who book for longer stays. Hotels can also offer incentives such as free parking or free breakfast to customers who book directly with them instead of through third-party websites.

This EDA involves following steps where in first step involves exploration and inspection over raw data, and second in second step I have dealt with data impurities and cleaned the data by andling null values and dropping irrelevent data from the dataset.

This EDA is divided into following 3 analysis: Univariate analysis: Univariate analysis is the simplest of the three analyses where the data, you are analyzing is only one variable. Bivariate analysis: Bivariate analysis is where you are comparing two variables to study their relationships. Multivariate analysis: Multivariate analysis is similar to Bivariate analysis but you are comparing more than two variables.

The project concludes that by analyzing hotel bookings data and understanding cancellations patterns, hotels can take steps to reduce cancellations and increase revenue.
# **Conclusion**
*   Guests prefer Resort Hotel most over City Hotel.
*   around 72.48% bookins are not canceled by guests but around 27.52% bookings are canceled by guests.
*   BB - (Bed and Breakfast) is the most preffered meal type by guests.
*   hotel was booked most times in year 2016.
*   August and July ware 2 most busy months in compare to others.
*   most guests come from PRT(Portugal).
*   TA/TO (travel agents/Tour operators) is most used distribution channel by guests for booking.
*   the room type A most preffered ( almost 55,000) by the guests while booking the hotel.
*   room type A is most assigned to guests.
*   agent number 9 has made the most number of bookings followed by agent number 240, 0, 14 and 7.
*   3.86% guests are repeated guests.
*   Transient customer type has most number of bookings.
*   Online TA (Travel Agent) has the most bookings.
*   City hotel most people stay for 3 days and in Resort hotel most people stay for only 1 day.
*   City hotel has more share in revenue generation over Resort Hotel.
*   City hotel has more waiting period. This could be because people stay more in City hotel as we saw in previous insight.
*   Resort Hotel has slightly more repeated guests over City Hotel this could be because of less waiting time in Resort Hotel and better service there because of less rush.
*   City Hotel generates more revenue in May months in comparison to other months.
*   Resort Hotel generates more revenue in between July and August months.
*   GDS has contributed more in generating the ADR. 
*   lead_time and total_stay is positively corelated. that means if customers stay more then the lead time increases.
*   adults,childrens and babies are corelated to each other. That means more the people more will be adr.
*   is_repeated guest and previous bookings not canceled has strong corelation. That means repeated guests don't cancel their bookings.
*   From the above pair plot we can see that if cancellation increases then total stay also decreases.
As the total number of people increases adr also increases. Thus adr and total people are directly proportional to each other.
